The magnitude of the force-oonstants involved can also be defined within narrow limits. The numerical values of the frequencies evaluated on the basis of the theoretical formulæ show a close agreement with the observed values. The geometry of the modes determines the changes in bond-polarisabilities and electron distributions produced by them, from which their activities in light-scattering and in infra-red absorption can be ascertained both in the first and in the second approximation. A comparison of the results with the experimental facts shows a striking agreement. The observed intensity of the second-order effects in relation to those of the first order indicates that the eigenvibrations are localised in volume elements comparable in size with the lattice cells of the crystal. © 1947 Indian Academy of Sciences.",,0,0,,,,undefined,

The present study reveals the following facts: (1) The Raman speetrum in the region of frequency shifts 90-200 cm.-1 exhibits seven lattice lines, the frequency shifts and intensities of which show marked variations with temperature. These lines have been identified as the fundamental modes of vibration of the cæsium chloride structure, in which the NH4 ions osciUate as units, as demanded by the new crystal dynamics. (2) The lattice spectrum persists far above the transition temperature. This fact indicates that Pauling's hypothesis that there is onset of free rotation of the NH4 ions immediately above the transitiort temperature is not corrcct. (3) The internal oscillations of the NH4 ions exhibit nine distinct Raman shifts, showing thereby that these osciUafions are not those of a freely vibrating ting tetrahedrally symmetric group.

Extensive study of the solvent property of various G-H mixtures has been made. The glycol forms hydrogen bonds with the —COO−end of the soap, and the alkyl group of the soap is dissolved by the H-solvent, and thus the mixture is more effective than the individual solvents. The cause of the hydrogen-bonding power of glycol in comparison with alcohols is ascribed to the effect of the interaction of one electronegative group on another, making the hydroxylic hydrogen atom of glycols more positive than it would otherwise be. The long known soap-dissolving power of phenols, cresols, methyl alcohol, etc., is also explained from this viewpoint. It has also been shown that inorganic salts having the group XOO-, where X is any non-metallic element, e. g., nitrites, hypophosphites, etc., have very high solubility in glycols owing to this glycolic interaction. © 1947, American Chemical Society.

A study of the literature in the reproduction of bats reveals that there are two types of sexual phenomena exhibited by bats, some bats experiencing a definite hibernation during winter after copulation in autumn, and others where copulation is immediately followed by fertilisation and gestation in spring. The bat Scotophilus wroughtoni does not show any evidence of a winter "" sleep "" and thereby falls into the second category. 2. Scotophilus wroughtoni has a sharply defined breeding season, copulation occurring at about the middle of March and followed immediately by fertilisation and gestation. 3. The period of gestation is about 105 to 115 days. 4. The age which this bat attains, as determined by its pregnancy records, may safely be placed at about three years. © 1947 Indian Academy of Sciences.",,12,0,,,,undefined,

Data regarding the variations in frequency shift dv, breadth and the proportional change d log v/dT are furnished for twelve of the important Raman lines of quartz. The proportional change is found to decrease progressively with the frequency shift of the Raman line, being highest for the low frequency lines and lowest for the high frequency ones. The temperature-frequency shift and the temperature-width curves for the individual Raman lines show similar characteristics, tending to flatten up at low temperatures and the rate of change being greater at high temperatures.

The seattered spectrum exhibits two pairs of Doppler-shifted components, one pair due to the longitudinal sound waves, and the other due to the two sets of transverse sound waves which have very nearly the same velocity. The velocities of the longitudinal and transverse sound waves estimated from the observed frequency shifts of the displaced components are in agreement with those calculated from the elastic constants of diamond. The directional dependence of sound velocity in diamond has been quantitatively verified. Contrary to expectation, the longitudinal Doppler components are found to be less intense than the transverse Doppler eomponents. The second-order spectrum of diamond has been examined with a quartz spectrograph of high dispersion and resolution. It exhibits a whole series of sharply defined Raman lines the frequency shifts of which have been tabulated. The prominent ones which are 15 in number have been satisfactorily explained as octaves of combinations of six of the eight fundamental frequencies of vibration of the diamond lattice to be expected on the basis of the Raman theory, some of which are split due to the removal of degeneracy by anharmonicity and due to resonance effect. © 1947 Indian Academy of Sciences.",,20,0,,,,undefined,

It is shown that the nature of the spectra is necessarily different in the two regions of frequency in whioh they represent respectively the characteristic eigenvibrations of the crystal structure and the stationary wave-patterns of elastic vibration. The eigenvibrations repeat themselves in volume elements within the crystal having twice the linear dimensions and eight times the volume of the lattice cells. The number of modes of eigenvibration is (24 p-3), p being the number of atoms in each lattice cell. The spectral frequencies which are (24 p-3) in number (or less by reason of crystal symmetry) ate accordingly monochromatic. In relation to the entire crystal, they are highly degenerate. The three missing degrees of freedom are exactly accounted for when the possible elastic vibrations which give a quasi-continuous spectrum of frequencies are enumerated. The limiting elastie wave-lengths come out as four times the lattice spacings of the crystal. The effects of anharmonicity are also considered. It is shown that they result in lowering and spreading out the spectral frequencies of the crystal when its temperature is elevated. © 1947 Indian Academy of Sciences.",,10,0,,,,undefined,

The monosporic tetranucleate embryo sac arises from a single megaspore of the tetrad by two divisions and is a characteristic feature of the entire family Oenotheraceae. Reports of its occurrence in other genera, viz., Codiaeum, Ceramanthus, Glochidion, Gastrodia, Commelinantia, and Trillium, are incorrect. A tetrasporic four-nucleate embryo sac is known only in Plumbagella micrantha. Here the four megaspore nuclei are unseparated by walls and soon assume a I+3 arrangement. At the commencement of the next division the three chalazal nuclei fuse to form a single nucleus, resulting in a secondary two-nucleate stage with one haploid and one triploid nucleus. Both nuclei divide again to give rise to a haploid and a triploid pair. There are no further divisions and the mature embryo sac consists of an egg cell, two polar nuclei, and an antipodal cell. Previous reports of the occurrence of a tetranucleate embryo sac in Plumbago and Ceratostigma have been shown to be incorrect. A bisporic tetranucleate embryo sac has been reported in four species of the Podostemonaceae but this needs confirmation. All other members of the family uniformly show an embryo sac of the Allium type with four nuclei at the micropylar and one at the chalazal end. The embryo sac of Cypripedium is not four-nucleate, as was once reported by Pace. It has six nuclei (sometimes seven or eight), organizing into an egg apparatus, two polar nuclei and one antipodal nucleus. In Clintonia all four megaspore nuclei are incorporated in the embryo sac but only the micropylar nucleus undergoes the next two divisions and the three chalazal ones promptly degenerate. This mode of development must be regarded as an extremely reduced form of the Fritillaria type.",,5,0,,,,undefined,

Differences in the two constants of milk occur from milking to milking, from day to day and between milks from different quarters of the udder. But the order of variation is unpredictable in every case. The different portions of a milking, however, exhibit a more or less uniform R.I. and a steady rise in the value of K from fore milk to strippings. But in all instances, pooling of the total yield from the animal restores the values to normal limits. The rainy season, when lush pasture is available for cattle, appears to Cause a marked rise in the limits of R.I. of milk, while the limits of K remain the same all through the year. Rigorous boiling of milk causes a steady rise in the values of both R.I. and K. All the data point to the fact that factors which cause a rise in the fat-free solids of milk also increase the measure of the R.I. The refractive constant, on the other hand, remains within normal limits owing to a corresponding change in the density of milk under natural conditions of variation. © 1947 Indian Academy of Sciences.",,6,0,,,,undefined,

Oxygen overvoltage has been determined on Pt at 25° C. at current densities ranging from 5×10-5 to 6×10-3 amp./sq. cm. in N and N/5 aqueous solutions of HF acid. Except Pt, Ag, and A1, the metals were used in electro-deposited form. Reproducibility of results varied from ±0·002 v. to ±0·02 v. according to current density. At current densities below 5 milliamp./sq.cm. the linear relation V=a+b log i between overvoltage and current density is found to hold good. For hydrogen overvoltage b=0·20 to 0·23 for non-attackable metals in N/5 solution and 0.145 for Pt in N solution of HF acid; for attackable metals the value of b is very small. For oxygen overvoltage on Pt in N and N/5 solutions of HF acid b=0.175. At current densities upwards of 5 milli-amp./sq.cm. the measured potential becomes increasingly larger than required by this relation. From an examination of the results obtained it appears that the behaviour of HF acid with respect to overvoltage phenomenon is essentially the same as those of H2SO4 and other similar acids, the observed departures being attributable to causes arising from weak ionisation of HF acid. Results for hydrogen and oxygen overvoltages on Pt indicate that the second break in the electrolysis of alkali and ammonium fluoride solutions may be due to electrode processes other than the primary decomposition of water. © 1947 Indian Academy of Sciences.",,0,0,,,,undefined,

Brief accounts of the literature dealing with the fungi Sclerotium cepivorum Berk, and Sclerotium tuliparum Klebahn are given. 2. Morphology of the two fungi has been described. The only spores produced by S. cepivorum are microconidia on certain media only. Attempts to germinate these microconidia almost uniformly failed as only 14 spores altogether germinated on 20 per cent, tulip juice. 3. A comparative cultural study of S. cepivorum and S. tuliparum showed that while both grew well on a great variety of media, nevertheless there was in the case of each a certain amount of specific reaction to the juice of its own host plant. In particular, crude onion juice is markedly inhibitory to the growth of S. tuliparum. Boiling of the juice largely removes this effect. S. cepivorum does not grow well in tulip juice, boiled or unboiled. 4. Sclerotium cepivorum is favoured by an acid reaction of the culture medium while Sclerotium tuliparum by a neutral or slightly alkaline reaction. 5. The temperature range of growth for both fungi is approximately l°-35° C., with an optimum near 20° C. 6. There is no significant difference by light factor either in growth rate or in the general appearance of the cultures of the two fungi. © 1947 Indian Academy of Sciences.",,0,0,,,,undefined,

Symptoms on the natural hosts and the modes of infection of S. cepivorum and S. tuliparum are described. While S. cepivorum appears to be able to penetrate the surface of uninjured roots, it does so relatively slowly and uncertainly whereas it freely enters at the stem base. The port of entry has been found the natural wound caused by the emerging root. In case of S. tuliparum it was the shoot bases and not the roots which were attacked. 2. S. cepivorum is able to attack onion seedlings over the whole range of soil moisture at which ready germination takes place-the greatest development of the disease being near about 40 to 60 per cent, soil moisture. As regards temperature effect, the optimum attack is somewhere in the neighbourhood of 13° to 18° C. 3. Under conditions which were sufficiently favourable to enable S. tuliparum to produce nearly 100 per cent, infection on tulips, S. cepivorum had no ascertainable effect whatsoever. 4. Neither S. cepivorum nor S. tuliparum is able to attack the host of the other. 5. S. tuliparum caused 80-100 per cent, infection of Tulips, Scilla sibirica, Hyacinth, Chionodoxa luciliœ, Iris hispanica; 40-60 per cent, of Gladiolus, Narcissus, Daffodil, Crocus, Snowdrop; 20 per cent, of rhizomes of winter Aconite; and produced no attack on onions, shallots and leek. S. cepivorum on the other hand attacked vigorously most of the onion types, leeks, shallots and red-onions only up to an extent of 20-25 per cent., while it could not attack the hosts of S. tuliparum. 6. It was noticed with both fungi that moist atmospheric conditions and autoclaved soil increased the pathogenicity on almost all the hosts. © 1947 Indian Academy of Sciences.",,0,0,,,,undefined,

As a result, in the dispersion formulæ for the three principal refractive indices of a biaxial crystal, the oscillator-strengths will be different, although the dispersion frequencies are the same. The application of the idea to the cases of calcite and aragonite (two strongly birefringent crystals) enables one to construct dispersion formulæ involving three ultra-violet frequencies at 1535, 1000 and 500 Å.U. The formulæ, which fit the dispersion data for both rays of calcite from 0·2 to 3 μ, show that a large part of the birefringence arises from the large anisotropy in the strength of the nearest ultra-violet frequency at 1535 Å.U. A similar result is also found for aragonite. The dispersion formulæ are also successful in explaining the thermooptic behaviour of both calcite and aragonite, when they are utilised in the author's theory of thermo-optic behaviour, which has so far been applied only for isotropic solids. For anisotropic solids, an additional principle has to be used, viz., that, while the total oscillator strength does not alter with temperature, the individual strengths along the three principal directions can change, resulting in a mutual transfer. It is suggested that this transfer is related to the differences in thermal expansion along the three directions, which finds some support in the case of aragonite. A physical explanation of the transfer can be found, wholly or partly, in the tilting oscillations of the CO3 ion. The theory is successful in explaining the remarkable fact that, while dn/dt for both indices of calcite is positive, that for all the indices of aragonite is negative, the difference being attributable to the much larger coefficient of thermal expansion of the latter. © 1947 Indian Academy of Sciences.",,8,0,,,,undefined,

Besides proteins and mineral substances, the two contain a high percentage of waxy matter. The less soluble portion (small amount) of the wax yields on saponification a non-steroid substance melting at 96-7° and having probable composition of C30H58O2. The more soluble major fraction yields artostenone on saponification. Experiments indicate definitely that this ketone is not occurring free and that it is formed as a result of the saponification. Though artostenone does not have the capacity of forming enolesters, α-artostenone yields an enol-benzoate readily. Further α-artostenone and its enol-ester undergo conversion into artostenone under the conditions of saponification. Hence the conclusion is drawn that in the plant it is α-artostenone that occurs in the form of enol-wax-esters. © 1947 Indian Academy of Sciences.",,4,0,,,,undefined,

The causalgia was severe in twenty of these cases. Permanent relief of pain following sympathetic block by paravertebral injection of procaine, even when repeated, was obtained only in the mild cases. Partial recurrence of pain was noted in four out of six cases following preganglionic sympathectomy or ganglionectomy. Ganglionectomy combined with periarterial sympathectomy of the subclavian artery gave complete relief of pain in seven cases of moderately severe and severe causalgia of the upper extremity. In the long-standing cases of causalgia, even though the pain was relieved, the functional results were poor due to the secondary fibrotic changes in the soft tissues of the hand. Early radical sympathectomy in ten cases prevented the development of contractures and other secondary changes. Early reparative surgery, within three weeks of the initial injury, followed by one or two paravertebral injections of procaine, was used in four cases-Relief of pain was achieved and secondary contractures were prevented. Early relief of pain is essential in order to prevent the development of soft tissue changes. This relief can best be obtained by early reparative surgery followed, when necessary, by paravertebral injections of procaine. Radical sympathectomy should be reserved for those patients in whom it is impossible to obtain clean healing of the wounds which involve the nerves or in whom the pain persists. Sympathectomy should be performed early, before the development of fibrosis and contractures. © 1947.",,5,0,,,,undefined,

The relative Joshi-effect %Δi, i.e., the percentage photo-diminution of the current in dark in a given frequency region varies as iaeriai >iHF >iLT >iLF, which is also the order in respect of their mean frequencies. The 'threshold potential' Vm is found to be independent of the nature of both the detectors and also of the frequency regions; for each of these, % Δi is maximum near Vm. The decrease on increasing the applied potential, in % Δi is attributed to the corresponding preponderance of iLF which is comparatively insensitive to the production of this phenomenon. © 1947 Indian Academy of Sciences.",,1,0,,,,undefined,

Making use of the dispersion formulæ of Huggins and co-workers, which employs one dispersion frequency for each oxide component, formulæ are developed, which give the rate of change of the refractive index with temperature, dn/dt. Computations made on the basis of these formulæ give fairly correct values of dn/dt for a large variety of multicomponent optical glasses studied by Pulfrich and by Peters. Although the formulæ give dn/dt fairly correctly for any particular wavelength in the visible, they do not give accurate values for the dispersion of dn/dt. The discrepancy is shown to be due to the inadequacy of using one dispersion frequency for each component in the dispersion formula. Using two frequencies, one of which is in the remote ultra-violet, and gives only a constant contribution to refractive index, new dispersion formulæ are derived and on their basis both dn/dt for any wavelength as well as its dispersion are correctly obtained. In addition, the theory also explains qualitatively other observations made on the thermooptic behaviour of optical glasses, such as the anomalous variations of dn/dt near the annealing and softening temperatures and broadly the correlation between composition and the value of dn/dt of the glasses. It is inferred that the proportionate variation of the dispersion frequencies of all the components diminishes with fall of temperature, and probably vanishes at very low temperatures, as is the case with crystals like diamond. © 1947 Indian Academy of Sciences.",,4,0,,,,undefined,

Rocksalt, sylvine and potassium iodide have been considered in detail. For this purpose, new dispersion formulæ embodying observed absorption frequencies have been developed for NaCl and KI. With KI, it is found that the proportionate variation χ [=-d (log v)/dt] of the first ultra-violet frequency at 2190 Å.U. measured by Fesefeldt agrees with what is calculated from the dn/dt data, thus verifying the fundamental basis of the author's theory. The theory successfully explains the whole course of the variation of dn/dt with wavelength in the case of rocksalt, and in particular the positive values of dn/dt near about 2000 Å.U. and its reversal in sign with increase of wavelength. The first three ultra-violet frequencies have χ's of the order of +100×10-6, +25×10-6 and - 30×10-6 respectively, the last one near 500 Å.U. not varying with temperature. With sylvine, dn/dt measurements in the visible and near infra-red are satisfactorily explained with similar values of χ as in rocksalt. The paper also contains a general review of the dispersion data for the alkali halides. It is shown that a dispersion formula of the Drude form is more appropriate for these salts than one of the Lorentz-Lorenz form. © 1947 Indian Academy of Sciences.",,4,0,,,,undefined,

Even the 5:7-dihydroxy-compounds, 3-O-methyl-galangin and 3:3′:4′-O-trimethyl-quercetin could be oxidised to the corresponding 5:7:8-trihydroxy-derivatives in good yields. Subsequent methylation yields the fully methylated ethers of 8-hydroxy-galangin and gossypetin and demethylation the free hydroxy-flavonols.

The importance of this formula is explained by showing that there is little actual difference in the rate of ascent whether the weight of attachments are added to the dead-weight of the balloon or subtracted from the free-lift before applying the formula.

It is shown that by applying the general theory of Part I one can satisfactorily explain both the variation of dn/dt with wavelength and the courses of the temperature-refractive index curves from -80° to 700° C. for different wavelengths. The calculations show that the ultra-violet dispersion frequency at 2532 Å.U. alters appreciably with temperature, the proportional rate of change χ=-d (log ν)/dt being 70×10-6. This is nearly ten times the corresponding rate for diamond. The rate of change becomes less and less on lowering the temperature.

About 10 c.c. of sample in a Gerber butyrometer is centrifuged for 5 minutes in an ordinary milk centrifuge. A few c.c. of the defatted milk is carefully collected without disturbing the fat layer and tested for R.I. It takes less than 30 minutes to test the R.I. of a dozen samples in this fashion ; and these values represent, unlike those of milk-sera, the true refractive index of milk. From the density and R.I. the refractive constant, K, has been calculated. The R.I. and K of more than 200 samples each of cow and buffalo milk have been tested over a period of 8 months. The limits of R.I. for cow milk lie between 1·3449 and 1·4480, the mode being 1·3463, and for buffalo milk between 1·3461 and 1·3500, the mode being 1·3480. K is distinct and lies within much narrower limits for each type of milk-cow milk 0·2065-0·2075, and buffalo milk 0·2076-0·2088. These limits, unlike those of R.I., are independent of the solids-not-fat content of milk. From the available data it is concluded that samples of cow milk with R.I. < 1·3449 and K < 0·2065, and buffalo milk with R.I. < 1·3461 and K < 0·2076 can be considered to be adulterated. © 1947 Indian Academy of Sciences.",,3,0,,,,undefined,

The dispersion formula however fails below 0·185 μ, and consequently two new formulæ have been developed holding down to 1300 Å. U., one of which uses dispersion frequencies at λλ 0·082, 0·1115 and 35·48 μ together with a non-unity constant in the expression for n2, while the other is of the Ketteler-Helmholtz type with four frequencies at λλ 0·045, 0·088, 0·1115 and 35·48μ. All the formulæ explain the variations of dn/dt, in particular, as to why it increases algebraically as one proceeds both into the ultraviolet and the infra-red. The interesting fact emerges that the extreme ultraviolet frequency at λ 0·045 μ does not vary with temperature, while the proportionate variation of the one at 0·0888 μ is much less than that of the one at 0·1115 μ. This result becomes intelligible when one remembers that the deeper levels in the crystal would be less affected by temperature than the low-lying ones. Even the last one, although it is of the same order, is only one half of the proportionate variation of the infra-red lattice frequency. It is also found that the rate of variation of the ultraviolet frequencies is constant at different temperatures. In these respects, fluorspar differs from diamond and vitreous silica. The difference has been attributed to the fact that the binding in fluorspar is not purely covalent, but is also partly electrovalent. © 1947 Indian Academy of Sciences.",,4,0,,,,undefined,

The refractive index variation can then be represented as the sum of two terms, one arising from the change in the number of dispersion centres and the other from the variation of the frequencies. Accurate data of the thermal variation of the refractive index of diamond have been obtained for the first time from - 180° C. to 450° C. for three wavelengths, 4358, 5461 and 5893 Å.U. A new method was employed for this purpose which measures dn/dt directly and is capable of general application.

Experiments on the sorption of ethyl alcohol at saturation pressure on the above proteins at 30°C. show that the nonsolvating liquid is either not adsorbed at all or taken up to a very small extent.

The effect, which is reproduced in the paper, is obviously connected with the rotation of the plane of polarisation of the polarised λ 2537 radiation as it traverses the crystal. The distance between one dark band to the next corresponds closely to a rotation of 180° of the plane of polarisation of the λ 2537 radiation. A similar effect was observed and photographed in smoky quartz by the present Lord Rayleigh in 1919 using the Tyndall scattering of visible light by the inclusions in the crystal. In the present case the effect is due to the diffusion of light arising from the atomic vibrations in the crystal lattice, and the clearness of the bands indicates that such scattering is strongly polarised. © 1947 Indian Academy of Sciences.",,3,0,,,,undefined,

With increase in the temperature of precipitation, there has been a diminution in the sorptive capacity of gels for water at different partial pressures and in most of the systems the hysteresis loop suffers a diminution in size with a change in the shape and position of the loop. But in none of these systems, is any complete elimination of the loop noticeable. Gels precipitated at 100°C. are less porous than the gels precipitated at 25°C. and appear to have fewer cavities that are responsible for the phenomenon of hysteresis. © 1947 Indian Academy of Sciences.",,1,0,,,,undefined,

The three stress-optic coefficients are q11=4·2×10-11, q12=-3·6×10-11, q44=2·6×10-11, from which the elasto-optic coefficients have been deduced to be p11=0·125, p12=-0·325, p44=0·11. It is found that q11-q12 and q44 are both positive and also that the refractive index of the crystal should decrease when subjected to a hydrostatic pressure, both of which are unique for diamond among the cubic crystals studied so far. In the course of the investigation, a new technique has been developed for determining the absolute path retardation, based on the production of localised interference fringes by the light coming from the two surfaces of the crystal. © 1947 Indian Academy of Sciences.",,5,0,,,,undefined,

Their acid values and absorption of Methylone Blue have been measured; there exists a fairly close relationship between these two values. It is suggested that the absorption of basic dyes by these lignocelluloses is due to the presence of acidic constituents of the hemicelluloses, rather than to lignin. The existence of an ester linkage between the hydroxyl group of lignin and the carboxyl group of polyuronic acid is postulated for nine fibres which, unlike the others, yield an appreciably higher percentage of carbon dioxide and furfural. © 1947 Society of Dyers and Colourists",,1,0,,,,undefined,

The first investigation was on wheat in the United Provinces, and the other two on paddy (rice) in the provinces of Bihar and Madras. The experiments were conducted by the staff of the departments of Revenue and Agriculture posted in the districts, who ordinarily carry out crop-cutting experiments under the official orders. The results of all the three investigations show that there is a definite risk of obtaining over-estimates of the average yield with small size plots. In contrast, plots of the order of 1/80th of an acre appear to be free from bias. The results also show that small plots fail to furnish unbiased estimates of the different components of the true variance. © Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",,8,0,,,,undefined,

The output from the pick-up microphone after suitable amplification and rectification is fed to a logarithmic stage to enable an energy range of 55 db. to be applied to the vertical plates of the cathode ray tube. A linear time base generator provides deflecting voltage for the horizontal pair, thus giving the decay trace in db./sec. Four values of the time for a single horizontal traverse of the spot-1, 3, 5 and 7 seconds-are provided to handle reverberation times of rooms from small studios to large auditoria.

The behavior of sodium oleate, sodium stearate and sodium palmitate toward 40 different organic solvents has been examined. It is found that the soaps do not dissolve in most of the solvents at room temperature, but swell on heating and give clear mobile solutions near the boiling point of the solvent. On cooling these solutions, any one of the following phenomena takes place, depending upon the nature of the soapsolvent system: (1) the soap remains in solution, (2) the soap crystallizes out, (3) a pseudo-gel is formed, or (4) a true gel is obtained. 2. 2. It is observed, in general, that the amount of the gel-like material obtained, that is, the gelating capacity of the soap-solvent system, increases roughly with the boiling point of the solvent. 3. 3. The behavior of the soap-solvent systems giving rise to true gels has been examined with special reference to the degree of supersaturation. It is observed that, if the soap content is low, crystallization occurs when the hot soap-solvent system is. cooled. With an increase in the concentration of the soap, a pseudo-gel is obtained at first, and a true gel is formed only when an optimum concentration of the soap is reached. Further, the transition from the crystalline state to the weak precarious pseudo-gels, and subsequently to the typical stable gels, is effected by very gentle gradations in the concentrations of the soap in the system. 4. 4. The temperatures of crystallization and of the formation of pseudogels and true gels have been measured in the case of the three soaps in 16 different solvents. The zones of concentrations in which the soap exists in the three different states have also been determined. © 1948.",,1,0,,,,undefined,

There is an acute dilatation and engorgement of the normally collapsed system of capillaries of the bone marrow in cholera. 2. 2. These capillary changes are more marked than in any other organ in cholera and might at least in some way partially explain the condition of great shock in this disease. 3. 3. Owing to the widening of the above capillaries it is possible to study their openings into the venous sinusoids of the marrow. 4. 4. The sinusoids are also distended. 5. 5. There is an increase in the number of eosinophils, and a variable amount of leucoblastic reaction of the marrow. 6. 6. Small lymphatic nodules have been observed in some cases. © 1947 Royal Society of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene.",,0,0,,,,undefined,

(3) Fission, formation of larva, case secretion, and metamorphosis into adult have been described in F. producta Wright var. nov. elongata. (4) Folliculina simplex Dons has the characteristic structure and life‐history described by Faureć‐Fremiet (1936). The mode of feeding in F. simplex has been recorded. (5) It has been established that the extremely long tube of F. producta var. nov. elongata is single and is formed by one larva alone. In this variety it is not the result of an end to end arrangement of the secondary tubes of successive daughter individuals described by Andrews and Fauré‐Fremiet in Folliciulinopsis producta Wright. (6) It has been shown for the first time that the spiral ridge on the tube of F. producta is formed by a specialized spiral band of cilia on the neck of the larva. 1947 The Zoological Society of London",,1,0,,,,undefined,

The meronephridia are derived from holonephridia by a process of branching and multiplication either at an early or a late stage of development. The tufted nephridia are either incompletely branched holonephridia or meronephridia secondarily grouped together. The two kinds of nephridia are further distinguished as open or closed according as they possess or lack an internal funnel, and still further as exonephric or enteronephric according as they discharge their excretory products to the exterior or into the gut. The holonephridia are almost all open and exonephric; closed holonephridia have been found only in one form, and in one form alone are the holonephridia only incipiently enteronephric. But it is the meronephridia that exhibit the greatest variation in number and size as well as form and disposition, leading to a progressive and divergent specialization in the Megascolecidae, the largest family of the Oligochaeta. As many as ten kinds of meronephridia are met with. The enteronephric system in six genera shows various stages of development from simple segmentally separate units to a single unified and elaborate system of the enteronephridia of the whole of the intestinal region. In one genus the meronephridia are known to be incipiently enteronephric. An account of the process of excretion is given. Analyses have been made of the urine, coelomic fluid and blood of Pheretima. The excretory substances are ammonia, urea and creatinine; they are initially formed in the body wall and gut wall, and are thence taken up both by the coelomic fluid and blood, which pass the excretory products to the nephridia for elimination to the exterior. The mechanism of nephridial excretion has been analysed into processes of filtration, reabsorption and tubular secretion. The initial nephridial filtrate consists of blood‐plasma minus the colloids, together with the coelomic plasma, but it is modified during its passage down the nephridial canal, as there is a large scale reabsorption of useful substances. Glucose and amino‐acids are completely reabsorbed, while PO C1, Na, K and creatinine are reabsorbed extensively along with water. The urine is really a protein‐free filtrate, but measurable quantities of protein find their way into it, probably from the mucus secreted by the worms during the process of collection. The brownish granules in the ciliated middle tube of nephridia are coloured by a haem pigment. The role of the nephridia in osmotic regulation has been determined by measurement of the depression of freezing point of blood, coelomic fluid and urine and by a comparison of the concentration of various substances in these fluids. The earthworm maintains a steady state like a freshwater organism. The adaptive significance of the enteronephric system is to enable Phcretima to conserve much of its water which is to a great extent returned to and reabsorbed by the intestine.
